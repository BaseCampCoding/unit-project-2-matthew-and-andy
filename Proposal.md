# Z Shooter
## Description and Motivation
This project will be a simple Pygame program about surviving a zombie outbreak.
It will include a wave system, a high score system, zombies, and a player character to take them on.
It will have a top-down perspective, with simple but colorful graphics.
The concept of a Call of Duty-esque zombie shooter seemed like something we would both enjoy working on.

## Prior Art
As mentioned above, this project is heavily inspired by the Call of Duty series staple Zombies mode. However, this game will have an interesting top-down perspective,
with the addition of unique weapons and the mentioned high score board. Of course, there are similar flash games on the internet of the same concept: top down zombie shooter.
This game will be unique in having various zombie types, similar to Left 4 Dead 2.

## Core User Workflows
This game will be centered around surviving an onslaught of zombies. Over time, Zombies will spawn more frequently, have more hit points, and can move faster.
In later stages of difficulty, different zombie types will spawn, like hulking beasts or speedy ones that are tiny.
As the player kills zombies, they will get money. They can use this money to buy weapons, ammo, health upgrades, and armor.
Their primary goal is to survive as long as possible. At the end of the game, once the player dies, they can give their name, and they will be put on their
local high score list. This list will include their name, how long they lasted, and how many zombies they killed.
Combat will be real-time, meaning events will happen even if the user leaves the keyboard.

## Tuesday-Thursday Daily Goals
### *Tuesday*
By the end of Tuesday, we plan to have the player movement and shooting finished. Movement will be done with the keyboard.
This day may also include adding zombies to the game.
